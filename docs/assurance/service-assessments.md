A service assessment measures a service against the [14 points of the GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). 

It's a space for service teams to get expert advice from a panel of specialists and peers. 

The governance model will not change how service assessments work. 

## Which services require assessment  

All transactional services require an assessment. 

A transactional service allows users to either:  

* exchange information, money, permission, goods or services 
* submit personal information that results in a change to a government record 

Internal services and services built using off the shelf software or software as a service also require an assessment. Spend control determines whether a non-transactional service needs an assessment. 

## Products and platforms  

Service assessments look at whole services, not just products or platforms. If a new product is added to a service, the entire service still needs to be assessed.  

## When service assessments happen  

Service assessments happen at the end of alpha, private and public beta phases.  

Teams may also hold a more informal workshop at the end of discovery.  

A service should also be assessed if:  

* it is new 
* it is being rebuilt 
* the team changes significantly 

An existing service may need an assessment if a service introduces new uses groups or user journeys. A lead assessor or service assessment manager will make this decision. 

Services in continuous improvement or which develop new features do not require assessment.  

## Who assesses the service  

Most Defra services will be assessed by an internal panel.  

A service is assessed by a cross-government panel if either:  

* the service is likely to handle more than 100,000 transactions per year 
* civil servants in more than one organisation will use the service
