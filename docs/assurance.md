Delivery teams should be aiming to work in the right way from the start.  

There are several ways we can assure our delivery, meaning we can keep on track, spot problems early and manage risk. 

Assurances a delivery group must use: 

* [spend control](spend-control) 
* [service assessments](service-assessments) 
* [operational service readiness](operational-service-readiness) 

[Other assurances](other-assurance-types) a delivery group is encouraged to use: 

* show and tells 
* service design authority 
* guardrail exceptions 
* architectural assurance 
* change management 
* cross-cutting technical services
