The model and assurances should be used by delivery groups to: 

* deliver [services]( https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/what-a-service-is) in an outcome-focused and [agile](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) way 
* operate with clarity and consistency 
* work in the open
